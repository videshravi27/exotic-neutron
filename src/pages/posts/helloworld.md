Hey all, this is my first post!

This post is about Astro, a new static site generator that I've been working on. It's a new project, so I'm still working on the documentation, but I wanted to share a little bit about it here.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a new static site generator that uses a new file format called Astro Components. Astro Components are a new way to write HTML components that can be rendered to HTML, SSR'd to a string, or even rendered to a different static site generator like Gatsby or Next.js.
